## Contribution Guidelines

<br>

We :heart: your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

<br>

### We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

<br>

### We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). 
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Create issue for bug, fix or features and get yourself assigned (to preserve your and others hard-work and time)!
2. After the previous important step, fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Create pull request and 
[link it to the corresponding issue](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#about-linked-issues-and-pull-requests)

<br>

### Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same 
[GPL License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the us if that's a concern.

<br>

### Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/RaghavGoyal12301/Hotel-Management-Solutions/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/RaghavGoyal12301/Hotel-Management-Solutions/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

<br>

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
**You can use our bug report template, that would be highly anticipated.**

<br>

### Coding Guidelines
Consistent coding styles have undoubted advantages, but for now we follow a very basic given below. 
We would request you sticking to these for ease of understanding and a litle bit of consistency. 

* 4 spaces or tabs for indentation
* Use descriptive variable names.
* Use `camelCasing`.
* Comments to thoroughly describe your particular code block's logic.

There are also some basic [Guidelines](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coding-standards-and-guidelines/), these are some good practices - you can read and folow.
